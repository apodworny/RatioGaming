            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>In Ratio Gaming, we have <strong>On Days</strong> and <strong>Off Days</strong>. These days are generally alternating. On days happen every even day of the month, and off days happen every odd day of the month. Showing up to on days is important, whereas showing up to off days is less important.</p>
            <p>A minimum of three hours any time between 7pm and 11pm central time is required for on days.</p>

            <h2>On Days</h2>
            <p>On days are for team development. These days are good for running deliberate team compositions, and playing roles that everyone is the most comfortable with. Do your best to show up and play well on these days.</p>
            <p>On days are every even day of the month. Example: January 2nd, 4th, 6th, etc.</p>

            <h2>Off Days</h2>
            <p>Off days are for personal development. Especially in the tryout phase it can feel like you need to perform consistently every game, and by doing that people play much safer and don't take as many risks. This consequently means that people don't learn as much. To counteract this, off days were introduced. For off days, feel free to play on your own or with other friends, or just go do your own thing. If you decide to show up then great, but we won't be playing to win, we'll be playing to learn personal skills. This often means heroes/roles you're not comfortable with.</p>
            <p>Off days are every odd day of the month. Example: January 1st, 3rd, 5th, etc.</p>

            <h2>Exceptions</h2>
            <p>There are exceptions to the on/off schedule. Tournaments or specifically designated practice days of course take priority over any on/off days, and are important to make it to.</p>
