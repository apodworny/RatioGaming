          <section>
            <h2>Ethos</h2>
            <p>Ratio Gaming is not just a team of random players that happen to be good at the game. Professionalism, skill, intelligence, and modesty are very important to the team ethos, all of which will be the main deciding factors for if you are a good fit for this team.</p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h2>Fun</h2>
            <p>Although we hold our players to higher standards, we are at the end of the day playing because we enjoy it. We try to make this as enjoyable of an experience as possible, while still understanding that the entire point is to play at a top tier competitive level.</p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h2>Competitive</h2>
            <p>This team is for those that wish to play at the top skill level of Paragon. In more ways than one, everyone is judged when they first start trying out with the team. Those that are not currently in the highest skill bracket can try out when spots are available, but they will have stricter requirements in some ways, and must be willing to take advice and improve to the required level to play competitively with the team. To put it simply, if you're gold but you're judged to be able to play at a diamond level, that's fine.</p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h2>Pro?</h2>
            <p>We believe to be a pro gamer you must be paid for playing competitively, typically by a team through sponsors. While we don't see ourselves being sponsored for awhile due to Paragon being relatively new, if we can consistently place among top 3 teams in tournaments, then we have an actual chance.</p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h2>Schedule</h2>
            <p>If interested, you need to generally be able to play daily during the week for at least 3 hours, between 6pm CT and 11pm CT. Weekends you must be able to make it to tournaments. While there will be specific practice days setup that are more important to make it to, during the tryout period it is particularly beneficial to play as often together as possible. That way it can be determined if you are a good fit for the team or not (and not just by us, perhaps you won't enjoy your experience as much as you thought you might).</p>

            <h2>Why 'Ratio' Gaming?</h2>
            <p>The first instance of the word 'ratio' used in recorded literature was latin, in 1636. At the time, ratio could be interpreted to mean a number of things, including 'reckoning', 'reason', 'rationale', 'judgement', 'understanding', 'calculation', and 'knowledge'. It was not until 1660 that the word was recorded being used in a mathematical context.</p>
